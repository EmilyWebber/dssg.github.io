When a young woman becomes pregnant before she’s ready, the risk factors for her and her baby escalate. Too often, the result is poverty, instability, and despair. 

[Nurse-Family Partnership](www.nursefamilypartnership.org) intervenes by pairing specially trained nurses with low-income families. Expecting mothers receive nurse home visits from pregnancy until the baby is two years old. The result: more successful pregnancies, more stable families, and healthier kids that do better in school and life.

NFP’s approach is based on successful randomized controlled trials. They’ve been around for many years and have programs throughout the country. But as federal health care reform invests millions of dollars into home nurse visits, they’re being asked to quantify their recent impact on child health and family stability.

We will measure their effectiveness by analyzing three years of data on NFP’s interventions and family outcomes.
