project: Smarter crowdsourcing for crisis maps
---
During disasters, information can become as scarce as food and electricity. First responders struggle to locate people in need.

Tech nonprofit [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com) is harnessing the web and mobile phones to change this. They crowdsource SMS and social media reports during crisis situations, and map them to give governments and aid agencies a real-time picture of what’s happening on the ground. 

During crises, Ushahidi’s volunteers must manually assign a category (i.e. “need food”) and location (“at State and Lake”) to every report before it can be mapped. As the number of social media reports has grown, volunteers are spending too much time sorting through irrelevant or repetitive tweets and not enough time vetting their accuracy or stripping out private information.

We’ll build a system that allows volunteers to train an algorithm that automatically classifies tweets during emergency situations. This will allow Ushahidi to more rapidly process data during emergency situations, avoid volunteer burnout, and empower social good organizations to spot emerging problems faster.
