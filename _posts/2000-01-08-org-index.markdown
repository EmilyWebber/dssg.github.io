Cities are now swimming in data. [311 service requests](http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/), [Twitter](http://foodborne.smartchicagoapps.org/), Google street view, [open government data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), Census surveys, and even [LIDAR](http://cityscan.com/) offer an unprecedented look into the problems faced by our cities. 

Sometimes, a single data element tells a story on its own, answering a specific question about potholes, lead exposure, or language proficiency. More often, we need multiple datasets to grasp the long-term trends affecting our neighborhoods - community cohesion and unrest, underinvestment in child health, and infrastructure decay. 

Each of these data sources has a different size, scope, and availability. Weâ€™ll combine the strengths of each to build new barometers of neighborhood health across Chicago - and hopefully expand to other parts of the country.

The goal is to give city policymakers a view of local trends, help community organizations respond more proactively, and make researchers more effective and efficient.
