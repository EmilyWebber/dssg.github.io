The Great Recession flooded Chicago with foreclosures, deepening the blight in the city’s economically distressed neighborhoods. The [Cook County land bank](http://www.cookcountylandbank.org/) is a new government agency dedicated to stabilizing these communities by redeveloping vacant and abandoned properties. 

We’re building a tool to help the land bank detect which properties in at-risk communities are the best candidates for acquisition. 

To do that, we’ll analyze Chicago’s real estate market and assemble data about every single property in the greater Chicago area - property sales, foreclosures, building inspections, zoning, and much more - in partnership with DePaul University’s [Institute for Housing Studies](http://www.housingstudies.org/).
