The Great Recession flooded Chicago with foreclosures, deepening the blight in many of the city’s economically distressed neighborhoods. Nearly 10% of Cook County's housing units are vacant, according to the least Census. To turn the tide in these communities, County Commissioner Bridget Gainer and President Toni Preckwinkle created the [Cook County Land Bank](http://www.cookcountylandbank.org/) in January, 2013. The land bank will return vacant and foreclosed properties to productive use - either as rentals, bought housing or open space.

In partnership with DePaul University’s [Institute for Housing Studies](http://www.housingstudies.org/), we’re building a cutting-edge, open source analytics tool to help the land bank make informed policy decisions about which properties acquire and redevelop. To do that, we’ll analyze Cook County’s real estate market and assemble data about every single property in the Cook County area - property sales, foreclosures, building inspections, zoning, and much more.
