<p>With over 63,000 students, Mesa Public Schools is the largest school district in Arizona. It serves the City of Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix. Around 75% of Mesa students who start ninth grade end up graduating high school, right in line with the national graduation rate.

<p>Although 95% of these graduates intend to go college or other training, only 68% attend within two years of graduation. Six years later, only 26-28% of graduates have a two or four year degree. That’s a lot of dreams deferred or denied.
 
<p>Many of these students are ready for college but simply don’t apply. Or, they get into college but don’t enroll, or enroll but do not complete a degree. Others are not prepared for college. We know, however, that all of them need post-secondary training for their future success.

<p>We’re going to analyze Mesa’s education data - including students’ classes, grades, test scores, college attendance, and more - in order to identify these college-ready candidates.

<p>We’ll also identify students who are aiming too low - that enroll in a two-year degree when they could be attending a four-year university - and graduates who show up to college on the first day but never collect their degree.

<p>The goal is to empower Mesa Public Schools to identify students likely to get off-track and to target these individual students with the support they need to enroll in college, graduate and embark on a  fulfilling career.
