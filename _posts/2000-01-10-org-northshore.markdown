project: Mining electronic medical records for better health
---

Electronic medical records (EMR) promise to improve our understanding of patients’ ailments and improve their care. Chicago’s [NorthShore Hospital](http://www.northshore.org/) has one of the most extensive EMR systems in the country. 

We’ll work with them to tackle two distinct medical problems:

1. Neurological disorders: We’ll use clinical data to build models that predict when individuals are at risk of brain problems.
 
2. Childhood obesity: [Growth charts](http://www.chartsgraphsdiagrams.com/HealthCharts/images/growth-2-20-boys.png) are a series of percentile curves that illustrate how kids’ height and weight change during childhood. Surprisingly, these growth curves are one-size-fits-all: there’s one version for each gender, but not much else.

Northshore hospital has 6 years of data on childrens’ growth. We’re going to use it to build personalized growth curves, which could allow doctors to detect childhood obesity earlier and enable them to intervene before it’s too late.
