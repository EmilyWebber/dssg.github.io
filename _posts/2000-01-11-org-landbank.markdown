The Great Recession flooded Chicago with foreclosures, deepening the blight in many of the city’s economically distressed neighborhoods. Nearly 10% of Cook County's housing units are vacant, according to the last Census. 

To turn the tide in these communities, County Commissioner Bridget Gainer and President Toni Preckwinkle championed the creation of the [Cook County Land Bank](http://www.cookcountylandbank.org/) which was passed by the Cook County Commission in January, 2013.  The land bank will return vacant and foreclosed properties to productive use - either as rental units, owner-occupied housing, or open space.

In partnership with the [Institute for Housing Studies](http://www.housingstudies.org/) at DePaul University, we’re building a cutting-edge, open source analytics tool to help the land bank make informed policy decisions about which properties acquire and redevelop. To do that, we’ll analyze Cook County’s real estate market and assemble data about  property sales, foreclosures, building inspections, zoning, and much more.
