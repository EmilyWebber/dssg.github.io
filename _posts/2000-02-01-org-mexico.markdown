project: Reducing Maternal Mortality Rates in Mexico
---

The maternal deaths in Mexico from pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum complications have decreased from 89 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 43 in 2011. Despite this improvement, the rate of decline has significantly slowed and Mexico is not on track to achieve its Millennium Development Goal of reducing maternal mortality 75% by 2015.
 
Our goal is to identify those factors contributing to maternal mortality and determine what can be done to reduce it. In contrast to previous work, we will be analyzing trends at a more granular level. While our initial work will focus on municipalities and localities, our hope is to develop  individual-level models of risk using all available data.
