project: Increasing Graduation Rates and Improving College Readiness for High School Students
---

To ensure that all students are on track for success beginning in the primary years, **Montgomery County Public Schools in Rockville, Maryland** built their own “early warning” model to identify students who are not making sufficient academic progress using data on grades, attendance, and other measures.
 
We will help the MCPS administrators validate and improve their model, using new sources of student-level data. In addition, we will look to broaden the objective to look at other measures of academic success.
 
The DSSG project will also build upon [last year’s work with Mesa Public Schools](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2014/01/16/mesa-undermining-undermatching.html), which sought to identify students not achieving their college potential. Each year across America, students consistently under-enroll in colleges – leading to lost college potential. With help from DSSG, MCPS hopes to improve the college going rate of its students and the caliber of institutions they attend.
