<p>The World Bank Group lends billions of dollars every year to fund large infrastructure projects around the globe. Project-related contracts are awarded to companies and entities via open and competitive bidding processes. Such processes can sometimes be subject to collusion and corruption risks.

<p>Working with data on major contract awards and projects, we will help develop a model that predicts potential collusion cases. The model will look for anomalous patterns of bidding and spending and subsequently alert the organizationâ€™s Integrity Unit to take a closer look at potentially suspicious behavior.
