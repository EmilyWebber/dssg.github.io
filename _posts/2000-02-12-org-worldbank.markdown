The **World Bank Group** lends billions of dollars every year to fund large infrastructure projects around the globe. Project-related contracts are awarded to companies and entities via open and competitive bidding processes. Such processes can sometimes be subject to collusion and corruption risks.

Working with data on major contract awards and projects, we will help develop a model that predicts potential collusion cases. The model will look for anomalous patterns of bidding and spending and subsequently alert the organizationâ€™s Integrity Unit to take a closer look at potentially suspicious behavior.
