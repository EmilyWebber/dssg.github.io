### The data deluge
As technology penetrates further into everyday life, we're creating a flood of data about our world. 

This data deluge is already reshaping business. Companies are hiring data scientists - an emerging hybrid of programmer, statistician, and domain expert - to turn big data into useful insights.

Business isn't alone. Data science could transform how governments and nonprofits tackle society's problems.

### The opportunity
By analyzing everything from police reports to website clicks to sensor signals, **governments** could start spotting problems in real-time and design programs for maximum impact. More **nonprofits** could finally measure whether or not they're helping people, and iterate to find what works.

None of this is inevitable, however. 

We're at the dawn of using data science for social impact. W	e face steep hurdles to the widespread adoption of analytics in the social sector:

- Most governments and nonprofits simply don't know what's possible yet.

- There are too few data scientists out there - and too many spending their days chasing ad clicks instead of bettering lives.

To move forward, we need to show social good organizations the power of data by doing high-impact analytics projects. And we need to train data scientists to tackle the problems that really matter.

### The fellowship
That's exactly why we're doing the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship at the University of Chicago. 

We want to jumpstart the field of <strong>impact data science</strong> by bringing three dozen aspiring data scientists to Chicago, and having them work on big data projects with social impact.

Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows will take on real-world problems in education, health, energy, transportation, and more.

Over the next three months, theyâ€™ll apply their coding and quantitative skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors in industry, academia, and the Obama campaign.

The program is lead by <strong>Rayid Ghani</strong>, former chief data scientist for the Obama 2012 campaign and newly appointed fellow at the University of Chicago's Computation Institute and Harris Public Policy School.

### The fellows
Rayid hatched the idea in February, and we put out a call for applications in early March. 

The response was overwelming: <strong>550</strong> aspiring data scientists applied from all over the world.

We read every application and interviewed nearly a hundred people. In the end, we picked 36 amazing fellows. 

(That's 6% of the applicant pool, for you bean counters.)

They'll be flying to Chicago from all across the county in early June.

We recruited deliberately from academia, and got what we asked for: the fellows are largely grad students, with a healthy dose of undergrads.

In terms of disciplines, they strike a good balance of the programming, statistics, and domain expertise skills that make up data science.

This too is deliberate: we don't believe in the all-knowing, do-everything data scientist rock star. We're going to focus on [building data science teams](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/eventseries/23/Building-Data-Science-Teams.pdf) this summer.

Our deepest thanks to everyone who applied, and everyone who's helped the fellowship in ways big and small.

### We can't wait to show you how data science can better the world - and why Chicago is the place the do it.
