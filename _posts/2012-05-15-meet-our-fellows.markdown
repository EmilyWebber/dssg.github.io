### The data deluge
As technology penetrates further into everyday life, we're creating a flood of data. We could quote all the Gartner and Forrester studies, but you know what we mean.

This increase in data and the need to make sense of it is already making businesses scramble to find data scientists - an emerging hybrid of programmer, statistician, and domain expert - to turn data into better decisions.

Businesses aren't alone. Data science (we use the current buzzword but previously created buzzwords such as analytics, machine learning, data mining, etc. also apply) could transform how governments and nonprofits tackle society's problems.

### The opportunity
By analyzing police reports to website clicks to sensor signals, **governments** have already started thinking about spotting problems in real-time and designing programs for maximum impact. More **nonprofits** are trying to measure whether or not they're helping people, and experimenting to design internventions to find the ones that work. 

None of this is inevitable, however. 

We're just realizing the potential of using data for social impact. We face hurdles to the widespread adoption of analytics in the social good world:

- Most governments and nonprofits simply don't know what's possible yet.

- There are too few data scientists out there - and too many spending their days optimizing ads instead of bettering lives.

To make an impact, we need to show social good organizations the power of data and anaalytics by doing high-impact analytics projects. And we need to expose data scientists to the problems that really matter.

### The fellowship
That's exactly why we're doing the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good summer fellowship at the University of Chicago. 

We want to bring three dozen aspiring data scientists to Chicago, and have them work on big data projects with social impact.

Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows will take on real-world problems in education, health, energy, transportation, and more.

Over the next three months, theyâ€™ll apply their coding and quantitative skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors in industry, academia, and the Obama campaign.

The program is lead by <strong>Rayid Ghani</strong>, former chief data scientist for the Obama 2012 campaign and newly appointed fellow at the University of Chicago's Computation Institute and Harris Public Policy School.

### The fellows
Eric Schmidt and Rayid came up with the idea in March, and we put out a call for applications as soon as we could. 

The response was overwelming: <strong>550</strong> aspiring data scientists applied from all over the world.

We read every application and interviewed nearly a hundred people. In the end, we picked 36 amazing fellows. 

(That's 6.545% of the applicant pool, for you bean counters.)

They'll be flying to Chicago from all across the country at the beginning of June.

The fellows are a mix of largely grad students and a healthy dose of undergrads.

In terms of disciplines, they strike a good balance of the computer science, machine learning, statistics, and domain expertise skills that make up data science.

This too is deliberate: we don't believe in the all-knowing, do-everything data scientist rock star. We're going to focus on [building data science teams](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/eventseries/23/Building-Data-Science-Teams.pdf) this summer.

Our deepest thanks to everyone who applied, and everyone who's helped the fellowship in ways big and small. This is our first time running this program so there have been some kinks that we've been busy fixing as we figure out things. Thanks for your patience as we do that.

### We can't wait to show you how data science can better the world - and why Chicago is the place the do it.
