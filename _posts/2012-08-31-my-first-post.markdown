As the internet penetrates ever deeper into our lives, we're creating a flood of data about our world. 

This data deluge could transform how governments and nonprofits tackle society's problems.

By analyzing everything from police reports to website clicks to sensor signals in real-time, **governments** could start spotting problems as they emerge and design programs for maximum impact. **Nonprofits** could finally measure whether or not they're helping people, and iterate to find what works.

None of this is inevitable, however. We're at the very dawn of using data science for social impact.

There are too few data scientists out there - and too many spending their days optimizing ad clicks instead of bettering lives.

Most governments and nonprofits simply don't know what's possible yet.

To seize the opportunity, we need ways of training people, and demonstrating what's possible.
