title: Meet our fellows 
author: Juan-Pablo Velez, Matt Gee

As technology penetrates into day to day life, we're creating a flood of data about our world. 

This data deluge is already transforming business. Companies are hiring data scientists - an emerging hybrid of programmer, statistician, and domain expert - to turn big data into useful insights.

This data deluge could transform how governments and nonprofits tackle society's problems.

By analyzing everything from police reports to website clicks to sensor signals, **governments** could start spotting problems in real-time and design programs for maximum impact. **Nonprofits** could finally measure whether or not they're helping people, and iterate to find what works.

None of this is inevitable, however. 

We're at the dawn of using data science for social impact. And we face steep hurdles to widespread adoption

- Most governments and nonprofits simply don't know what's possible yet.

- There are too few data scientists out there - and too many spending their days chasing ad clicks instead of bettering lives.

To move forward, we need to show social good organizations the power of data by doing high-impact analytics projects. And we need to train data scientists to tackle the problems that really matter.

That's exactly why we're doing the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship at the University of Chicago.  We want to jumpstart the field of <strong>impact data science</strong>.

The program is lead by Rayid Ghani, former chief data scientist for the Obama 2012 campaign and a newly appointed fellow at the University of Chicago's Computation Institute and Harris Public Policy School.

449 people applied from all over the world.

Plenty of college towns were represented - and lots of Latin Americans!

We read every application and interviewed nearly a hundred people. In the end, we picked 36 amazing fellows. 

(That's 6% of the applicant pool, for you bean counters.)

They'll be flying to Chicago from all across the county in early June.

We recruited deliberately from academia, and we got what we asked for: the fellows are largely grad students, with a healthy dose of undergrads.

In terms of disciplines, they strike a good balance of the programming, statistics, and domain expertise skills that define data science.

This too is deliberate: we don't believe in the all-knowing, do-everything data scientist rock star. So we're going to focus on [building data science teams](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/eventseries/23/Building-Data-Science-Teams.pdf).


Our deepest thanks to everyone who applied, and everyone who's helped in ways big and small.

We can't wait to show you how data science can better the world - and why Chicago is the place the do it.
