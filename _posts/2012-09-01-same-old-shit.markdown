			I <a href="http://rainypixels.com/words/gray-matters/">recently left Microsoft</a> to start a company named <a href="http://weareminky.com">Minky</a> with my wife, Pita. We never planned on doing client work but when my ex-manager and champion of good things at Microsoft, <a href="http://about.me/JeffSandquist">Jeff Sandquist</a>, invited me to come on board to help design the Build 2013 experience, I, or should I say, Minky, couldn&#8217;t resist. Having collaborated on <a href="http://rainypixels.com/words/build-it-fast/">the creative for the 2012 conference</a> with the <a href="http://paravelinc.com">3 amigos</a> and Jeff, I was excited at the prospect of helping evolve the Build brand.

<p>Yesterday marked the launch of <a href="http://buildwindows.com/announcement">a simple, one-page announcement site for Build 2013</a> that Minky helped design and build in approximately a week. The concept relied on faking masks in the browser to reveal parts of an underlying image as the user scrolled. With weak browser support for masks, the task proved to be particularly tricky to implement responsively across the target browser stack because of known <a href="http://css-tricks.com/percentage-bugs-in-webkit/o">sub-pixel rendering issues using percentages in Webkit browsers</a> (let&#8217;s save that for another day). All in all, despite the apparent simplicity of the design, it turned out to be terrifying to pull off.</p>
