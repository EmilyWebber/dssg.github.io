There aren’t enough of us data scientists around. We want to train more, and get them working on the [problems that really matter](/2013/05/21/the-fellowship-and-the-fellows.html). Lots of folks have been asking about how we're doing that.

Computer science and statistics take years to learn. There's no way to bring people up to speed during a few weeks. 

Instead of starting from scratch, we went after students in computational and quantitative fields, folks that already have some of these skills and use them daily in an academic setting. And we gave them the opportunity apply their abilities to real-world problems - and to pick up the ones they’re missing.


#### Applied science
There's a learning curve, of course. But we think the best way to learn any applied science is to get your hands dirty. That’s why we’ve developed analytics projects with governments and nonprofit organizations for fellows to dig into.

Working on real projects is also a great way to pick up the practical skills that round out the data science skill set: absorbing a new domain, turning a vague problem into one that can be solved analytically, and building useful solutions.

Some [our fellows](http://www.dssg.io/people) excel at creating algorithms that learn from data. Others are great at analyzing social networks, or writing software.

But nobody can do everything. So we built diverse teams for each project.

This presented us with two challenges:

- Effective teams require close collaboration.

- To bridge the diversity of fellow backgrounds, we needed a common toolbox.

So we invited our friends from [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) - a nonprofit which teaches scientists to code - to run a tech bootcamp for our fellows.

#### Collaboration tools
To get fellows working together, instructor Elliott Hauser (picture above) introduced them to [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [github](http://www.github.com/dssg), tools which make it easy to share code and collaborate. Though popular in the world of software engineering, few fellows had used them before.

Eliott also got fellows [pair programming](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/11/pair-programming-vs-code-reviews.html), where two people code together on one computer.

"Individually, our knowledge is like swiss cheese. But collectively, we know all these different things we can share,"
says fellow Syler Whorton. "It's a lot more beneficial than taking individual classes."

#### Common toolkit 
Every computational or quantitative field has its favorite tools. Our fellows are familiar with dozens of technologies:

To give everyone a lingua franca, we did workshops on python and R.

As a general purpose programming language, python is useful for dealing with data. ([Click here](http://www.quora.com/Python-programming-language-1/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists) for a good overview of its strengths for data science.) 

R is the go-to free tool for statisticians, and has tons of advanced statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization libraries. 

We focused on using python for data analysis. Although most fellows were familiar with python...

 ...not all of them had used [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), powerful libraries for scientific computing.

Fellows were also exposed to [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), a library for creating beautiful data graphics.

Instead of tailoring the sessions to different ability levels, we experimented with giving everyone a shared experience. This approach had its downsides:

"We all come from so many different backgrounds and levels of knowledge that sometimes it felt like not everyone was getting same amount out of it," says fellow Breanna Miller. "But I think trying to lay the groundwork so we're all on the same page was really helpful."

Of course, nobody learns a new tool in a day. The point was to give fellows a whirlwind overview of the tools available to them, so they go deep on the ones they find useful over the course of the summer.
