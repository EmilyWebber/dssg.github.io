Karl Fogel is an open source software developer, author, and consultant. In 2005 he wrote [Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project](http://producingoss.com/) (O'Reilly Media), based partly on his experiences in the [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) project.

He is now a partner at [Open Tech Strategies](http://opentechstrategies.com/), where he helps organizations launch and engage with open source projects. He has worked as an open source specialist at CollabNet, Google, Canonical, O'Reilly Media, and Code for America.

Karl talked to fellows about the history of open source, practical aspects of starting and maintaining open source projects, and the growing use of open source in government.
