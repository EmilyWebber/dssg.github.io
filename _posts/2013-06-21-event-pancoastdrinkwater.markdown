[Douglas Pancoast](http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/douglaspancoast/) is a professional architect and an associate professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He's worked for architecture and tech firms including Richard Meier and Partners, 1100 Architect, BlackBox Studio at SOM, and agency.com. He created Until Architecture in 2006, a design studio that examines the role of software, sensors, and actuation on the built environment.

Pancoast's current interests include examining how large, public data sets (economic, environmental, social, cultural, civic) are a context for creative practice. Pancoast is a co-investigator for the [Urban Sciences Research Coordination Network](http://www.urbanccd.org/2012_12-002.php), an NSF grant meant to build inter-institutional research capacity around "big data" for social benefit.

[Robb Drinkwater](http://www.splintergroup.com/) is a Chicago artist and adjunct assistant professor at the School of the Art Institute.

Pancoast and Drinkwater presented projects produced at the SAIC and in their individual practices that collect and and use data on the physical environment, including a prototype for a robotic agricultural agent, a gift vending installation for a trade fair, [bicycle mounted data sensors](http://chi.streetsblog.org/tag/mote-o-bike/), and various projects from the [GFRY studio](http://www.saic.edu/webspaces/gfry_re/gfryRE.html) - a research and project production studio at the SAIC partially funded by Motorola.
