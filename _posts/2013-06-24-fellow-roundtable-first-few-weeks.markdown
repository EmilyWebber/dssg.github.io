The Data Science for Social Good fellowship is just getting started. Fellow Skyler Whorton wrote a [blog post](http://dssg.io/2013/06/11/welcome-to-chicago.html) reflecting on week one of the program. 

We've brought thirty six fellows with diverse backgrounds and perspectives to Chicago. So let's hear from a few more voices about how things are going so far. 

For our first **fellow roundtable**, we're trying out [branch](http://branch.com), a new social media service that makes it easy to host conversations on the web.
