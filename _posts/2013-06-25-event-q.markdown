[Q Ethan McCallum](http://qethanm.cc/) works as a professional-services consultant, author, and speaker. Having built a solid foundation in IT infrastructure and software development, his consulting work currently focuses on strategic matters of analytics. 

 His written work includes [_Parallel R_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021421.do) and [_Bad Data Handbook_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024422.do), two titles on data analysis. He is currently working on his next book, [_Making Analytics Work_](http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/04/every-leader-has-their-how-i-got-here-story.html), a management-level guide on how to build an analytics practice. 

 Q's talk explored the what, how, and why of Hadoop and Elastic MapReduce, tools for working with large-scale data and computation. He distilled his tutorial -- usually delivered as a three-hour lecture/lab session -- into a one-hour crash course for the fellows.
