We spent much of the first week of the fellowship [getting fellows up to speed](http://dssg.io/2013/06/08/training-data-scientists-tools.html) on git, python, R, and other data science tools. The idea was to give everyone a shared sense of what's out there so they can collaborate and teach other over the summer.

We've invited a few of our fellows to reflect on this tech bootcamp and on how peer learning is working at Data Science for Social Good.

(We're using [branch](http://branch.com) for our fellow roundtables, a new social media service that makes it easy to host conversations on the web.)
