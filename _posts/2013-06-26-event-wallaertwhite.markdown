event: Psychology in Data Science; A Unifying Perspective on Means, Medians, and Modes
---
[Matt Wallaert](https://twitter.com/mattwallaert) is a behavioral scientist at Bing, where he uses the psychology of behavior change to create products that help people lead more satisfied lives. He has exited two startups, publishes academically in the area of Judgment and Decision Making, and cofounded [GetRaised.com](http://getraised.com), a free service that works to close the gender wage gap by helping women figure out if they are underpaid and do something about it.

Matt talked about using data to change human behavior. He argued behaviors are a product of competing pressures - reasons to do something (promoting pressure) and reasons not to do something (inhibiting pressure) - and that the way to change behaviors is to understand these pressures and modify them - both of which require data to do well.
 
[John Myles White](https://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite) is one of the core developers of [Julia](http://julialang.org/), a programming language specially designed for processing massive data sets. Before becoming a Julia developer, John completed a Ph.D. in psychology at Princeton University, where he applied large-scale data collection methods to the study of human decision-making. John is also the author of [Machine Learning for Hackers](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hackers-Drew-Conway/dp/1449303714), published by O'Reilly Media.

John talked about a [fresh way](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2013/03/22/modes-medians-and-means-an-unifying-perspective/) of thinking about statistical means, medians, and modes.
