Jos√© Lobo is part of the Research Faculty at Arizona State University, and has been studying urban economic development and innovation for the past twenty years. 

Trained in physics, applied mathematics and urban economics, his research has examines the drivers of urban economic growth, the factors that foster invention in cities, and the interplay between entrepreneurship, creative activities, human capital and social organization in creating wealth in cities.

Jose talked to Data Science for Social Good fellows about the work of the Urban Scaling Working Group at the Santa Fe Institute on developing a "science of cities." He lead a conversation about how the interplay between urban "big data", theory construction, computational approaches, and modeling can result in a deep understanding of how cities work.
