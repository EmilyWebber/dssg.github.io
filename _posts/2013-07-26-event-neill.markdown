Daniel B. Neill is the Dean's Career Development Professor and Associate Professor of Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, where he directs the Event and Pattern Detection Laboratory and the Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Policy.  

His research focuses on machine learning and event detection in massive datasets, with applications ranging from medicine and public health to law enforcement and security. His detection methods have been incorporated into deployed disease surveillance systems throughout the world, and his "CityScan" software is in day-to-day operational use by police to predict and prevent emerging hot spots of violent crime. 

He received his M.Phil. from Cambridge University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from CMU. Dr. Neill was the recipient of an NSF CAREER award, and was named one of the "top ten artificial intelligence researchers to watch" by IEEE Intelligent Systems.
