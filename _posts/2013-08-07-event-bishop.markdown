Rob Bishop, an engineer and evangelist for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, will present a talk entitled "Raspberry Pi - One Year On" that will cover both the origin story of the Raspberry Pi as well as outlining recent developments. The talk will present technical information about the Raspberry Pi alongside a discussion of the Foundation's educational aims. Following the presentation, there will be an opportunity for an in-depth Q&A on both educational and technical matters.

Rob Bishop was the first technical employee at Raspberry Pi and is currently one of the two full time software engineers. Alongside his engineering responsibilities, Rob also acts as an "evangelist" who works to promote the educational mission of the Foundation. Rob has given talks about the Raspberry Pi at various events worldwide, in venues ranging from conference halls to community meetings in garages.
