Paco Nathan is the chief scientist for [Mesosphere](http://mesosphe.re/), a big data software company based in San Francisco. He is a recognized expert in Hadoop, R, cloud computing, distributed systems, machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing. 

Paco is a contributor to the [Cascading](http://www.cascading.org/) open source project, and is the author of the O'Reilly book “Enterprise Data Workflows with Cascading.”

He received his BS in Math Sciences and MS in Computer Science from Stanford, and has 25+ years experience in the tech industry ranging from Bell Labs to early-stage start-ups.

Nathan's talk will focus on Cascading and Mesos, two emerging big data technologies used by Twitter and other Silicon Valley companies. Cascading provides an abstraction layer API for integrating Apache Hadoop with other data frameworks. It leverages functional programming to make large-scale apps faster to build and test, and less complex to maintain. Mesos is an open source cluster scheduler API which improves cluster utilization and multi-tenancy for high ROI apps.
