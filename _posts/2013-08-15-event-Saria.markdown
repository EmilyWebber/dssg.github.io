event: Machine Learning Methods for Structure Discovery in Time Series Data with Application to Risk Prediction in Infants
time: 12:30pm

Recent years have seen an explosion in the availability of time series data related to virtually every human endeavor â€” data that demands to be analyzed and turned into valuable insights. In this talk, I begin by presenting my recent work on discovering recurring structure in continuous time series data. I motivate the use of probabilistic frameworks in capturing priors that can help guide unsupervised discovery. I show two different sets of models we built in the context of data collected from physiologic sensors in the inpatient setting and from tracking human activity. In the latter half of my talk, I dive deeper into the application of physiologic monitoring of infants. We devise a novel risk prediction score called Physiscore that combines patterns from continuous physiological signals to predict infants at risk for developing major complications in the neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Using only 3 hours of non-invasive data from birth, Physiscore very successfully predicts morbidity in preterm infants. Physiscore performed consistently better than other neonatal scoring systems, including the Apgar which is the current standard of care. This work was published on the cover of Science Translational Medicine (Science's journal aimed at translational medicine work), and was covered by numerous press sources.
