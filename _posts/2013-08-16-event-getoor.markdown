There is a growing interest in integrating, analyzing, visualizing and making sense of large collections structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.   In the world of big data, data science provides tools to help with this process – tools for cleaning the data, integrating and aligning the data, tools for finding patterns in the data and making predictions, and tools for visualizing and interacting with the data. Three common tasks that often need to be performed when working with large, heterogeneous data are:  entity resolution - determining when two references refer to the same underlying entity; collective classification - labeling nodes in a graph with their types or categories in a manner which takes into account their dependences; and link prediction – predicting relationships between entities.   In this talk, I will focus on entity-based data science, data science techniques which support the tasks of entity resolution, collective classification, and link prediction in a holistic manner which takes into account both entity attributes and relationships among the entities.

Lise Getoor is a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Her primary research interests are in machine learning and reasoning with uncertainty, applied to graphs and structured data. She also works in data integration, social network analysis and visual analytics. She has six best paper awards, an NSF Career Award, and is an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fellow. She has served as action editor for the Machine Learning Journal, JAIR associate editor, and TKDD associate editor.  She is a board member of the International Machine Learning Society, has been a member of AAAI Executive council, was PC co-chair of ICML 2011, and has served as senior PC member for conferences including AAAI, ICML, IJCAI, ISWC, KDD, SIGMOD, UAI, VLDB, WSDM and WWW.  She received her Ph.D. from Stanford University, her M.S. from UC Berkeley, and her B.S. from UC Santa Barbara.
