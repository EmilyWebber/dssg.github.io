Rachel Schutt has a PhD in Statistics from Columbia University, and is a Senior Research Scientist at Johnson Research Labs (an NYC start-up). Prior to that, she was a statistician at Google Research for several years. She is an Adjunct Assistant Professor in Columbia’s Statistics Department, and a founding member of the Education Committee for the Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering at Columbia. Rachel created the first data science course at Columbia (and one of the first in the United States), Introduction to Data Science, and is co-authoring a book called “Doing Data Science” to be published by O’Reilly in 2013 based on the course. 
 
She holds several pending patents based on her work at Google, where she helped build user-facing products by prototyping algorithms and building models to understand user behavior. She is interested in defining data science from a humanist perspective and finding ways to train the next generation of problem solvers to solve society’s problems and problems we don’t even know exist yet.
