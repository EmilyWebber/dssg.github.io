The Data Science for Social Good mentors are the core of the fellowship. As experienced data scientists from industry and academia, the mentors bring both technical knowledge and real-world experience to the program. They’re helpful guides for the fellows and their projects, and liaisons for the partner organizations. Finding the right people with both technical skills and an interest in social issues is no easy task; we’re pleased to have found several such individuals to join us this summer.

<a href="http://sociology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cagney.shtml"><img src="/img/people/cagney.jpg" alt="Kate Cagney" align="right" height="200" width="200"></a>**Kate Cagney** is an associate professor of sociology and health studies at the University of Chicago, and director of the [Population Research Center at the National Opinion Research Center](http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/). Cagney's work examines social inequality and its relationship to health with a focus on neighborhood, race, aging, and the life course.  She has developed a series of papers on neighborhood social capital and its relationship to outcomes such as self-rated health, asthma prevalence, physical activity, and mortality during the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Currently she works on two Chicago-based studies of neighborhood context and older adult health, examines the role of the social and physical environment in older adult well-being with the [National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project](http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-project.aspx), and has started research on the social impact of the upcoming [Chicago Lakeside Development](http://chicagolakesidedevelopment.com/), a 600-acre, entirely new neighborhood that will be built on Chicago’s South Side.

<a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~chandola/"><img src="/img/people/chandola.jpg" alt="Varun Chandola" align="left" height="200" width="200"></a>**Varun Chandola** is an Assistant Professor at University at Buffalo (SUNY) in the Computer Science Department, where he is part of an NSF-funded center for [Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering](http://www.buffalo.edu/provost/policies-and-resources/efund/1213funded/cdse.html). His research covers the application of data mining and machine learning to problems involving big and complex data, focusing on anomaly detection -- finding surprising patterns, connections, associations, and trends in data. Previously, Chandola worked as a scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, seeking analytic solutions for climate, sustainability, and health care.

He works at the intersection of computer science, economics, and public policy, and spends half his time doing original research in computational social science and the other half building practical tools aimed at solving real-world problems with data. He directs the Center for Impact Measurement, co-founded [Effortless Energy](http://goeffortless.com/), the new [Chicago Policy Review](http://chicagopolicyreview.org/), and the [Harris Energy Association](http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/content/harris-energy-association), and he currently leads the [Chicago School of Data project](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/projects/chicago-school-of-data/). His areas of focus include computational social science, climate policy, energy use behavior, science and technology policy, housing, and program evaluation.

After graduating from the University of Chicago, where he studied physics, he developed software systems for computer aided diagnosis and data analysis tools in medical physics, analyzed and fused large messy geospatio-temporal data sets while a graduate student in geophysical sciences at UChicago, and conducted research at Cambridge University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and in Antarctica. His interests are in image analysis, data mining, evolutionary algorithms, computational fluid dynamics, inverse problems, and open source software development. At Emphanos, he deploys open source tools to solve data integration and system integration problems that help nonprofits advance their mission.
