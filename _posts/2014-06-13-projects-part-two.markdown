It was a busy week of working with and learning from our project partners, in person at the DSSG space on State Street, on video chats, and in conference calls. Fellows heard how a diverse range of organizations -- point-of-sale data analysts, non-profits working on homelessness and health insurance, government agencies covering education and public health -- currently collect and use their data, as well as the problems they would like to solve using data in the future. 

By the end of the week, the vague outline of each project started to fill in with detail, and fellows were ready to look at their data with the new perspectives provided by project partners. In that spirit, here's additional details on three more DSSG projects, covering important questions in energy, health care, and social services.

Millions of homes around the world are now equipped with “smart meters.” Data generated by these meters present the previously untapped potential to create economic opportunities and support the operation of a more distributed, resilient, and cleaner electric grid. Researchers and companies are only beginning to tap smart meter data to manage a smarter, more efficient electric grid and create energy management platforms and products that appeal to consumers.

Texas-based non-profit **Pecan Street Inc.** operates the world’s largest database of consumer energy information: **WikiEnergy**. This database is highly granular, including use measurements collected at 1-minute intervals from up to 24 circuits within the home. With access to this rich source of information and an algorithmic-based approach model, DSSG will develop new residential energy management tools. For example, a model may infer appliance-level usage patterns to identify wasteful appliances, provide savings advice based on future consumption forecasts, or use weather conditions to help homeowners optimize thermostat settings. These tools may be used connect consumers with the powerful data generated by smart meters, help move the needle on energy savings, and create products that improve consumers' lives.

<h4><a href="http://www.enrollamerica.org/">Enroll America</a> & <a href="http://getcoveredillinois.gov/">Get Covered Illinois</a> - Targeting the Uninsured for Health Insurance Enrollment</h4>
<p></p>

During the first open enrollment period under the new Affordable Care Act (ACA), over 8 million people obtained health insurance. But an estimated 13.4% of Americans remain uninsured, including over 1 million residents of Illinois. **Enroll America** is a nonprofit organization focused on maximizing the number of Americans who are enrolled in and retain health coverage. **Get Covered Illinois** is the official health marketplace for Illinois and is the federal partner responsible for leading all ACA education, outreach and enrollment efforts statewide. In its first year, Get Covered Illinois and its over 200 statewide grant funded partners enrolled over half a million Illinoisans in the Health Marketplace and ACA Expanded Medicaid program. 

The two organizations are working together to help identify and engage Illinois’ uninsured population in preparation for the next open enrollment period, from November 15, 2014 to February 15, 2015. Using the databases of both of these groups, we will construct models of the best channels of communication and key messaging to reach the different subpopulations of the uninsured in Illinois and other states. These models will help inform their collective outreach strategies and support their continued efforts under the ACA to bring health coverage to all Americans.

<h4><a href="http://www.nursefamilypartnership.org">Nurse-Family Partnership</a> - Optimizing Treatment for Expectant Mothers</h4>
<p></p>
<img src="/img/partners/nfp.jpg">

**Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)** is an evidence-based community health program that provides first-time, low-income mothers with regular home visits from registered nurses, through pregnancy and the first two years of their child’s life. These visits promote healthy pregnancies, child care, and economic self-sufficiency in vulnerable populations during a critical time in a mother and child’s life. The program has been rigorously tested in randomized controlled trials since 1977, and nurses collect extensive data about their visits and family outcomes.
 
<a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2013/07/31/the-match-game.html">Last year</a>, DSSG helped NFP find new ways to measure its effectiveness in different communities, combining the organization’s data with national demographic data to assess how the nurse visits affect measures such as the child’s vaccination and the mother’s employment and economic status. This summer, we will build an outcomes dashboard for NFP to monitor their performance on various measures and with different regional and demographic populations. The team will also build a “client triage” model that identifies mothers who may benefit the most from NFP’s program, and examine how different frequencies of home visits affect mother and child outcomes. The results will give NFP a clearer understanding of the target population that they can best serve, and the optimal “dosage” of nurse visits to benefit the families they assist.
