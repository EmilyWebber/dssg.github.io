<h3>Who Applied for the 2015 Summer Program? Chapter 1</h3>


<p />

Fellow applications just closed for the 2015 Summer Fellowship and we were excited to see almost 800 people apply! As we review these applications and make extremely difficult decisions, we'll spend the next few blog posts talking about who applied: Where did they come from? What backgrounds do they have? What are they studying? what skills do they have? What are they interested in working on? What motivates them to apply their skills to social good?
