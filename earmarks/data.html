            <h4 class="faq-subtext">What Is an Earmark?</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                "Among practitioners and scholars, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hjackson/Earmarks_16.pdf">no single definition</a> of the term <i>earmark</i> is universally accepted." For this project, we treat congressionally directed budget items allocated to specific people, places, or projects as earmarks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that our operating definition does not depend on a value judgment (good or bad) about earmarks.  Earmarks may be good, conditionally good, or bad; although we hope that this dataset can help shed light on which, we leave it in the hands of others to determine.
            </p>

            <h4 class="faq-subtext">Why Another Earmarks Dataset?</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                Our goal was to build a tool that finds earmarks in congressional texts, not a dataset of earmarks itself. Datasets are naturally static objects that require regular care to remain up to date. Our tool not only creates historical datasets but can continue to update those datasets with minimal time and effort. As the saying goes, give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, we are providing 
                Automated identification also provides a way to consistently enforce a standard. What one person would consider an earmark another person might not, which makes comparisons across human-created datasets difficult. The <a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/m012606.pdf">Congressional Research Service</a> (CRS), <a href="http://cagw.org/reporting/pig-book">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> (<a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hjackson/Earmarks_16.pdf">Porter and Walsh</a>, 2006), and the <a href="https://earmarks.omb.gov/earmarks-public/">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) either use inconsistent or unclear standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, our approach has its own problems. Senators and representatives allocate money   We wrote table parsers based on congressional texts from 2008, 2009, and 2010,

            <h4>Where Do I Download the Dataset?</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                You can find the dataset in CSV format <a href="/earmarks/candidate_earmarks.csv">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>How to Use the Dataset?</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                The dataset  

                <p>
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support vector machine</a>: score provides distance from the hyperplane.  The score is analogous to a predicted probability, where a score of 0 is similar to a predicted probability of 0.5.  A large, positive magnitude indicates the candidate is likely an earmark; and a large, negative magnitude indicates the candidate is likely not an earmark. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The user needs to choose a cutoff at which everything above is considered an earmark and everything below is not. This choice has consequences: the higher the cutoff, the less likely we are to find both true and false earmarks.  Thinking about the extremes helps clarify the concept:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Few scores will exceed a very high cutoff. The good is that you will not find many false earmarks; the bad is that you will not find many of the earmarks.</li>
                        <li>Most scores will exceed a very low cutoff. The good is that you will find almost all the earmarks; the bad is that you will also find lots of false earmarks.</li>
                    </ul> 

                    While it would be convenient for us to release a dataset based on a cutoff we chose, giving the user flexibility encourages project-specific, reasoned choices. (See <a href="http://www.bu.edu/polisci/files/2010/10/Case-Control-Methods-BU.pdf">this paper</a> for further discussion.)  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forcing the user to choose a cutoff also brings transparency to the identification process. Unlike the human-coded datasets, the cutoff provides a clear standard for categorization, and it enables discussion of model sensitivity (for example, what happens to the model when you choose a different cutoff?)

            <h4>What is DSSG?</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                Data Science for Social Good is a fellowship program at the University of Chicago connecting young data scientists and non-profits. Our purpose is social good. We create open source tools that help communities, organizations, and individuals use their data intelligently for their benefit and for the benefit of others. <a href='http://dssg.uchicago.edu/'>Click here to learn more about our fellowship program.</a>
