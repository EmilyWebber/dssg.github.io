The passage of the Affordable Care Act immediately made it possible for all Americans to get healthcare coverage regardless of whether or not they have pre-existing medical conditions, and to get government subsidies to make that care affordable.

Nonetheless, many of the uninsured are unaware of what the ACA has meant for them. They don't know that that they are eligible for free or subsidized coverage under the new laws, or even that the ACA exists.

*Enroll America* is a not-for-profit organization that conducts outreach campaigns across the US to make people aware of their new coverage options. *Get Covered Illinois* is the state of Illinois's program for encouraging more Illinoisans to sign up on Illinois's healthcare exchange. While Enroll often deals with personal contacts, the state focuses on large-scale advertising.

We are working with data from these two organization to help them improve the effectiveness of their campaigns. In practice, this means that we are working on building a number of different models:

* A *persuadability* model that suggests how likely it will be that someone will be interested in enrolling.
* A *contactability* model that suggests how easy it will be to contact people at different times of the day.
* A *language* model that suggests the right language to use when carrying out outreach.
* An *uninsuredness* model that suggests how likely it is that different groups are uninsured.

The fellowship officially ends on August 22, and until then we'll scrubbing data, debating models, drinking too much coffee, and debugging [Python](http://www.python.org) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/) code to make the best solutions possible.
