<p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="http://datascience.wufoo.com/forms/2014-summer-fellowship-application/">application form</a>
by February 1, 2013 and make sure your references also fill out the <a href="http://datascience.wufoo.com/forms/recommendation-form-2014-summer-fellowship/">
recommendation form</a></p>

<p><strong>When does the fellowship start and finish?</strong></p>
<p>We'll start end of May and finish end of August. We're working on figuring out multiple start dates that can accomodate different end of quarter/semester dates</p>

<p><strong>Is it a full-time program and do I have to be in Chicago?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to be a student to apply?</strong></p>
<p>Not neccesarily but this is designed for current student or recent graduates.
If you have finished a degree (undergrad, Masters, Phd) in the past couple of years, you should be ok to apply.</p>
