  <h4>General Questions
   </h4> 
  <p class="text-success">What is the goal of the fellowship?</p>
  <p>The fellowship is a project-based training program designed to produce data scientists with strong skills in solving real-world problems and an understanding, excitement, and passion for solving problems with social impact.</p>
  
  <p class="text-success">What is the culture of the fellowship?</p>
  <p>Collaborative, Creative, and Inclusive. We know we don't know everything and want everyone involved to shape the fellowship. We're open to ideas, criticism, and help. Yes, we are data-driven but more than that we're problem-driven. We care about impact and how our work is used to improve society.</p>
  
   <p class="text-success">What happens during the fellowship?</p>
  <p>Most of the summer, fellows work with their team on their project. We augment that with lectures, hands-on workshops, seminars (from local and visiting guests), happy hours (with the local tech, data science, non-profit, and government communities), meet-ups, field trips, and other social activities (sailing trips, tours, concerts, etc.). Some of these are planned in advance, others are co-created and led by the fellows and mentors as they learn about what they would like to do over the summer.</p>
  
   <p class="text-success">What are the start and end dates for the fellowship?</p>
   <p>We start end of May and continue until the end of August. In order to balance the start and end dates for both Semester and Quarter-based universities, exact dates will be announced soon. Semester students start a little earlier and Quarter students finish a little later.</p>  
  
   <p class="text-success">Where does the fellowship take place?</p>
   <p>Downtown Chicago. This allows fellows to experience the summer in the city as well as interact with Government, Non-Profit, Tech, and Data communities in Chicago.</p>
  
 
  <h4>Fellows
   </h4> 
   <p class="text-success">How do I apply?</p>
   <p>Fill out the application form by February 1, 2014 and make sure your references also fill out the recommendation form
  </p> 
   
 <p class="text-success">What makes for an ideal fellow?</p>
   <p>We want a mix of people who make up an ideal community for the summer fellowship. There is no single profile for a fellow. Successful fellows have different skill profiles and backgrounds. Everyone has some programming and some statistics and data analysis skills and a passion for making a social impact. Some are stronger at Computer Science and Machine Learning. Others have a strong Applied Math or Statistics background. Some come from a quantitative Social Science, Economics, or Public Policy background. Others have Physics or Chemistry or Geography or Linguistics degrees. We're not expecting you to be awesome at everything. Tell us what you're good at and what you'd like to learn. Personality and commnunication skills matter! If you're passionate about a cause or social issue, tell us about it in your application. If there's a recent project you've done that you're proud of, we'd like to hear about it.</p>
   
 <p class="text-success">What year do i have to be in school to apply?</p>
   <p>Although we'd love to have people at all levels invovled, we prefer you to be a grad student or at least a senior in college to get the most out of this program.</p>
   
 <p class="text-success">Are you only looking for tech and computer science geeks?</p>
   <p>No, not at all! We love CS geeks but in order to solve high impact problems, we need a mix of skills. We want people from all kinds of backgrounds including sociology, economicds, public policy, public health, georgraphy, physics, chemistry. We do want you to have experience with data analysis and a passion for making social impact.</p>
   
 
  <p class="text-success"> Is it a full-time program and do I have to be in Chicago?</p>
  <p>Yes. And Yes.</p>
  
    <p class="text-success"> Do I have to be a student to apply?</p>
  <p>Not neccesarily but this is designed for current student or recent graduates. If you have finished a degree (undergrad, Masters, Phd) in the past couple of years, you should be ok to apply.</p>
  
 
 <p class="text-success">Are the fellows paid? What is my stipend?</p>
   <p>Yes, we do pay the fellows. The stipend ranges from $11000 to $16000 for the 12 weeks depending on your experience and level of education. This include the housing stipend which is around $1000/month (and is more than enough for Chicago)</p>
   
   
 <p class="text-success">What about housing?</p>
   <p>We have arranged for housing in downtown Chicago. Fellows have the option to stay there or take the housing stipend and find their own housing. Most fellows choose to take the official housing in downtown but it is a bit like a dorm so fellows with families prefer alternatives.</p>
   
   <p class="text-success">Do fellows select their own projects?</p>
   <p>Partially. We spend the months leading up the fellowship designing projects with project partners. Once the fellows are selected, we will send you a list of these projects and ask you to give us your preferences. We'll then use these preferences and the needs of the projects to create project teams.</p>
   
   <p>You can see projects from last year <a href="projects/">here</a>. Projects will be in partnership with government and non profit organizations and will be in areas of education, healthcare, energy, community development, disaster relief, and public safety. We'll send out a specific list of projects with our decision by March 15.</p>
   
   
    <h4>Mentors
   </h4> 
  
  <p class="text-success">What is the profile for an ideal mentor?</p>
   <p>An ideal mentor has a strong technical background (in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Social Science, or Public Policy) and significant industry experience. We want mentors to have real-world problem solving experience as well as experience in leading teams and working with students and industry partners. Basically, we're looking for experienced, smart, and passionate unicorns who want to make a social impact working with fellows and our project partners over the summer.</p>
   
   <p>In the last two years, we've had a mix of successful mentors from Industry and Academia (with practical, real-world experience) with Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Social Science, Economics, Applied Math and Physics backgrounds</p>
   
   
  <p class="text-success">Are mentor positions full-time or part-time?</p>
   <p>Our priority is to have full-time mentors. These are paid, full-time positions. We welcome part-time volunteer mentors as well but need strong, full-time mentors for the fellowship to be successful.</p>
   
   <p class="text-success">Are mentors paid?</p>
   <p>Yes, full-time mentors are paid positions. Part-time mentors are volunteer positions and not paid. 
</p>

  <p class="text-success">What is the role of mentors in the fellowship?</p>
   <p>Mentors are a critical component of the fellowship. Each mentor leads (typically two) teams of fellows and serves as a project lead, technical advisor, and manages our relationship with the project partner. Mentors also help us design the activities over the summer and are an integral part of the organizing team.
