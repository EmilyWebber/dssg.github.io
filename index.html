      DSSG is a <strong>University of Chicago</strong> summer program for aspiring data scientists to work on big data projects with social impact.

      Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows will take on <strong>real-world problems</strong> in education, health, energy, transportation, and more.

      For three months in Chicago, they’ll apply their coding and math skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors in industry, academia, and the Obama campaign.
