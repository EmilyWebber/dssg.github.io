  <p>
  	This summer, our fellows will work on data science projects in health, education, energy, transportation, and more.
  </p>
   <p> 
  	Our program is intensive and hands-on. Fellows will work directly with <strong>nonprofits</strong>, <strong>local governments</strong>, and <strong>federal agencies</strong>, learning about what they do and tackling data problems they face.
  </p>
  <p>
  	We're strong believers in open knowledge and open source. We'll blog extensively about our projects, and make much of our research and code open to everyone.
